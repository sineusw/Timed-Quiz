# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

For this week’s homework I to built a timed quiz with multiple-choice questions. It features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. This was the first time I used JavaScript so extensively. I am really proud of the work I did for this week’s assignment.
